# What is Sentry?

Sentry is an open-source platform that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real-time. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for error tracking, crash reporting, and performance monitoring, allowing you to identify and resolve issues before they impact your users.

## Why Sentry with FastAPI?

FastAPI is known for its robust error-handling capabilities. However, integrating Sentry takes error handling to the next level by providing real-time error alerts, detailed error reports, and performance insights. This combination allows you to:

- Detect and diagnose issues quickly.
- Monitor the health and performance of your FastAPI application.
- Prioritize and track error resolution tasks efficiently.

## Benefits of Sentry Integration
